# csv-reader-project

A simple CSV reader to report and analyse an input CSV.

This project contains two seperate approaches to demonstrate how we can read a CSV using TypeScript and node.

- Composition approach: Utilising an interface based approach
- Inheritence approach: Utilising abstract classes and generics
